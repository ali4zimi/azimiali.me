A few years ago, I was using Laravel for my projects, and I was new to the world of open source. Once I needed a package that facilitates messaging and a chat system for my B2B project. 

Then, I found a package from [Mosunza](https://github.com/musonza), who has many other useful PHP projects. I imported one of his packages named [chat](https://github.com/musonza/chat) into my Laravel project but then I noticed that I need a small modification for my project. So, I went to the source code of his project and modified the code according to my project's needs and it worked perfectly. But after some time, I found out that there is a problem. I was using Google App Engine for my project production level, and it was really new for me and I didn't know that when I push my code there, the packages will be imported from their main sources, and the changes that I brought on local source code will not be there. Therefore, I decided to change the source code which helped me to learn more about open-source systems. It was not my intention to contribute or bring these changes myself, I just opened an [issue](https://github.com/musonza/chat/issues/273) and waited for the maintainers to answer or show me a solution.

After one day, I received a reply from the owner of the project, and he said feel free to pull a request. So, I forked the project and I started to learn about the pull request and how to do it. The first time I did a pull request was incorrect, and I learned that it is not possible to delete a pull request, instead, it should be closed, so I closed it and reopened another.

After my commits were pushed, I saw my name on the list of contributors and it felt so good.

From that, I tried to contribute on github projects. However, it is really difficult in my country Afghanistan to be an active contributor because of many factors such as internet connection, the lack of contributors and education system. Despite that, I guess if people have a cheaper internet connection it would be possible to learn it online.
