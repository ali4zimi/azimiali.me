Getting Started with Node.js

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and high-performance applications on the server side. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of installing Node.js and creating a simple "Hello, World!" application.

Step 1: Installing Node.js

1. Visit the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)) and download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.

Step 2: Verifying the Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

```console
node -v
```

   This command will display the installed version of Node.js. Make sure you see a version number, indicating that Node.js is successfully installed.

Step 3: Creating a Node.js Application

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

```console
npm init
```

   Follow the prompts to provide information about your project. Press Enter to accept the default values for most fields.

Step 4: Writing the Application Code

1. Create a new file named `app.js` in your project directory.
2. Open `app.js` in a text editor and add the following code:

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
3. Save the file.

Step 5: Running the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory if you're not already in it.
3. Run the following command to execute your Node.js application:

```console
node app.js
```

   You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal, confirming that your application is running successfully.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and executed a basic Node.js application. This tutorial provides just a glimpse of what Node.js can do. Explore the Node.js ecosystem further to leverage its vast collection of libraries and frameworks for building robust and scalable web applications, APIs, and more.
