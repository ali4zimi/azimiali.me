You might see a tiny sidebar to the right side of your Microsoft Edge browser if you updated it to the latest version. That is a helpful sidebar where you can use Bing AI mode and DALL-E directly from there. Apart from that you can see a green tree logo called E-Tree. 

If you use Microsoft Edge every day, and make it your default browser, it gives you the opportunity to plant a real tree. The question is how is this working?

From the sidebar of your browser, you can open it and you will see that it has daily perks that you can complete and in return, you can collect some water for your tree. While completing these tasks, you gain knowledge and information about numerous topics about the environment such as climate change, desertification, and green environment.

After completing these tasks, you receive water. Then, you can use this water to grow up your tree from level one to level 10. As soon as your tree reaches level 10 you will receive a certificate that indicates your accomplishment, and Microsoft will plant a real tree for you in Kenya.

Here you can see my certificate
