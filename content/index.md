# Ali Azimi
As a highly skilled Front-End Developer with over six years of professional and freelance experience, I am
proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Laravel.

I have a strong background in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications while
adhering to the best practices in Search Engine Optimization (SEO). With a deep understanding of Back-End Web
Development and Database Administration, I have worked extensively with MySQL, PHP, and other relevant
technologies. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Management and Technology at the Technical University of
Munich, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest front-end development trends and technologies to
provide innovative solutions to complex challenges.
