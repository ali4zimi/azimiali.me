# Welcome!
I am [Ali Azimi](https://github.com/ali4zimi), and I build websites and open-source projects. Currently, I study at the [Technical University of Munich](https://tum.de){:target="_blank"}. 

My fascination with computers began during my teenage years, and I've nurtured this interest since childhood. In fact, at the young age of 12, I even designed my very own computer game. Since that time, my curiosity has only grown, leading me to delve into programming and web development. 

With over six years of professional and freelance experience, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I am proficient in working with frameworks such as Vue.js and Nuxt, allowing me to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies to provide innovative solutions to complex challenges.
