# Welcome!
**I am Ali Azimi.**

I design and develop websites, and I love open-source projects. Currently, I study at the [Technical University of Munich](https://tum.de){:target="_blank"}. 

I can say that I have been a computer geek and I have been interested in computers since I was a child. I designed a computer game when I was 12 years old. 

Since then, I have been interested in programming and web development. With over six years of professional and freelance experience, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like  Vue.js, and Nuxt. 

I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies to provide innovative solutions to complex challenges.
