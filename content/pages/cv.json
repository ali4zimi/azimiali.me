In this course, I will learn the things I was curious most about such as microservices and cloud computing. The exercises are quite exciting and also time taking. Since 4 years, it was a question for me that companies like facebook and Google, how they manage multiple servers and how they manage data in all over the world. I am sure, by the end of this semester, I will be able to implement my own cloud application with multiple servers.",
